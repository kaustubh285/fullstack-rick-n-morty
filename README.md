### Project Workflow

1. The frontend extracts the page number from the URL (page 1 if none exists) and makes a request to the backend for page data.
2. The backend communicates with the Rick and Morty API to fetch alive Morty s data.
3. The backend formats the data and sends it to the frontend.
4. The frontend then displays a paginated grid of alive Mortys, View Profile shows the detailed page of the Morty.
